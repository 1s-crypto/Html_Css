            <p>
                This cat is a <strong>Prostitute</strong> well a male one you need to see the amount of female cat's that flock
                around that wigga and he doesn't give a damn if your looking at him he's gonna do what he want's to and then he'll give
                you a very provocative glance like what you gonna do and then after all his silly night games.He would come in the morning and be
                sleeping like an overnight worker he'll be so tired you can literally move him from where he is and he wouldn't know.Father tried
                to stop him once from going out but bruh sneaked out through the window🤣.I usually check for him before I close the door's and all
                only for me to see paw print's leading to the toilet I just started laughing🤣.He came in the morning and was giving father a
                how did the stopping me plan go😏😝.
